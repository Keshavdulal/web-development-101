Internet
The internet is a network of linked computers from around the globe. Each of these computers communicate with each other in a specific format.

Data Packets
Packets are the information of the internet. Packets are sent from the sender to the receiever in a specific format which contains all the information needed to communicate.

Differences between a webpage, web server, web browser and search engine
    * A webpage is the page you look at in your browser
    * A web server is the computer that has the code for how the webpage should look and act.
    * A web browser is a program on a computer that displays the web page.
    * A search engine is a web server that searches all other web servers for information. A user can then pull up the webpage on their web browser and search for a site.

Client
A client is the computer or internet device that requests information from the server.
SERVER
    * A server is the computer that receives requests (as packets) from the client and responds with the appropriate data.
 DNS servers 
    * DNS Servers are the "phone book" of the internet. They translate IP addresses into domain names.
